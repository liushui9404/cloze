It was raining. I went into a café and asked for a coffee. 1 I was waiting for my drink, I realized that there were other people in the place, but I sensed 2 . I saw their bodies, but I couldn’t feel their souls 3 their souls belonged to the 4 .

I stood up and walked between the tables. When I came to the biggest computer, I saw a thin, small man 5 in front of it. “I’m Steve”, he finally answered after I asked him a couple of times what his name was. “I can’t talk with you. I’m 6 ”, he said. He was chatting online with somebody—probably someone he didn’t know and, 7 , he was playing a computer game—a war game. I was 8 .

Why didn’t Steve want to talk with me? I tried 9 to speak to that computer geek(怪人), 10 not a word came out of his mouth. I touched his shoulder, but no reaction. I was 11 . I put my hand in front of the monitor, and he started to shout, “ 12 !”

I took a few steps back, wondering if all those people in the café were looking at me. I 13 , and saw nobody showed any interest.

14 , I realized that the people there were having a nice conversation with their machines, not with people. They were more 15 having a relationship with the 16 , particularly Steve. I wouldn’t want to 17 the future of human beings if they preferred sharing their lives with machines 18 with people.

I was worried and I sank in my thoughts. I didn’t even 19 that the coffee was bad, 20 Steve didn’t notice there was a person next to him.
