Time is very important in our lives. It 1 our everyday moments. However, time never had any 2 in my life until I received a watch from my father that organized my life and made me more 3 .
It’s round in the center with two silver hands that go around my wrist. And all of it is made of silver. This 4 tells me the importance of time in my life.
I received this 5 on a gray-sky day. I had to go to the airport at 9:00 AM to 6 up my Uncle Ali and take him to my father’s house. 7 , I was late because I was 8 out with my friends. Later on that day, around 11:00 AM, I 9 my uncle, but I was very 10 for him. He had 11 the airport and taken a taxi to my father’s house.
I got to my father’s house at 2:00 PM on the same day and looked at my angry father’s face. I felt 12 of myself at that moment. After I said hi to my 13 father and tired uncle, my father asked me to sit next to him where he handed me this watch as a gift from him. Then he said, “Essa, did you have 14 with your friends today?” I answered, “Yes father, and I’m sorry about not picking up my Uncle Ali.” He said, “What you 15 was not very nice and you should be sorry for your 16 ” I was ashamed and said, “Father, I’ll never do it again. I promise.” He said, “I hope today you learned something important, and this watch will be a 17 for you.” He told me to take this watch and use it as an organizer of my 18 .
I learned a very important lesson from my father: to 19 time and never be late to get someone. This watch is 20 to me, not because of its price, but because of the lesson that I learned from it.
