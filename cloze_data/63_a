As a teenager, I felt I was always letting people down. I was rebellious on the outside, 1 on the inside, I wanted people to 2 me.
　　
Once I left home to hitchhike to California with my friend Penelope. The trip wasn’t 3 , and there were many times I didn’t feel safe. One situation in particular 4 me grateful to still be alive When I returned home, I was different, not so outwardly sure of myself.
　　
I was happy to be home. But then I noticed that Penelope, who was 5 with us, was wearing my clothes. And my 6 seemed to like her better than me. I wondered if I would be 7 if I weren’t there. I told my mom, and she explained that 8 Penelope was a lovely girl, no one could 9 me. I pointed out, “ She is more patient and is neater than I have ever been.” My mom said these were wonderful 10 , but I was the only person who could fill my 11 , She made me realize that even with my 12 — and there were many — I was a loved member of the family who couldn’t be replaced.
　　
I became a searcher, wanting to 13 who I was and what made me unique. My 14 of myself was changing. I wanted a solid base to start from. I started to resist pressure to 15 in ways that I didn’t like any more, and I was 16 by who I really was. I came to feel much more 17 that no one can ever take my place.
　　
Each of us 18 a unique place in the world.You are special, no matter what others say or what you may think. So 19 about being replaced.You 20 be.
