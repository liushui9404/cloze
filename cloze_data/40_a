I work as a volunteer for an organization that helps the poor in Haiti. Recently I took my son Barrett there for a week, hoping to 16 him.

Before setting out, I told Barrett this trip would be tiring and 17 . For the first two days, he said almost nothing. I worried the trip was too 18 for a 17-year-old. Then, on day three, as we were 19 over high rocky mountains, he turned to me and grinned(咧嘴笑),“Pretty hard.”

After that there was no turning back. A five-year-old girl, wearing a dress several sizes 20 large and broken shoes, followed Barrett around, mesmerized(着迷). He couldn’t stop 21 . Later he said 22 , “I wish I could speak French.” I was 23 — this from a boy who hated and 24 French classes throughout school.

Usually silent, he 25 Gaby, our host, and kept asking questions about the country and its people. He blossomed(活泼起来).

26 , the moment that really took 27 breath away occurred in a village deep in the mountains. I was 28 a woman villager for an article. [135] centimeters tall, she was small in figure but strong in 29 . Through determination, she had learned to read and write, and 30 to become part of the leadership of the 31 .

Learning her story, Barrett was as 32 as I by this tiny woman’s achievements. His eyes were wet and there was a 33 of love and respect on his face. He had finally understood the importance of my work.

When leaving for home, Barrett even offered to stay 34 as a volunteer. My insides suddenly felt struck. This 35 achieved all I’d expected. Soon he will celebrate his 18th birthday. He’ll be a man.
