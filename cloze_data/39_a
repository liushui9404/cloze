It was a bright spring afternoon when Freda told me she wouldn’t need me any more. I had just finished my four-hour work- 36 up and down the stairs of her three-storey home, cleaning the floor and washing the dishes. She was 37 jeans and a sweater, sitting at the table I had just 38 . A pile of papers spread around her. Her husband’s 39 was going to be reduced by thirty percent. And they were trying to live as if it had 40 happened. I felt sorry for her, but I also felt a sense of 41 .

I had been cleaning Freda’s house for five years and had 42 an unexpected relationship with the family. It was not just 43 I had become an expert at scraping(刮掉) dirt stuck to their wooden floor, 44 that I had learned exactly how to place toys on the girls’ beds. It was 45 than that, for I felt I had become a part of their 46 .

Freda stayed at home with the kids, 47 I would often see her in the morning 48 them to school. And I’d be there when they 49 home at lunch for sandwiches and piano practice. I had 50 them grow up. Now I was tired, but the 51 thing was that I still wanted to keep scraping away the dirt and dust for the family.

I left Freda’s house that day, wondering about the 52 of my relationship with my clients(主顾). Who am I 53 them? As a matter of fact, I’m 54 an employee—the lowest kind of employee. But I’m also a trusted 55 of the family. I can’t help worrying about what happens around me.
