I know I should have told the headmaster at the time. That was my real 1 .

He had gone out of the study for some 2 , leaving me alone. In his absence I looked to see 3 was on his desk. In the 4 was a small piece of paper on which were written the 5 “English Writing Prize [1949]. History Is a Series of Biographies(人物传记)”.

A(n) 6 boy would have avoided looking at the title as soon as he saw the 7 . I did not. The subject of the English Writing Prize was kept a 8 until the start of the exam so I could not 9 reading it.

When the headmaster 10 , I was looking out of the window.

I should have told him what had 11 then. It would have been so 12 to say: “I’m sorry, but I 13 the title for the English Writing Prize on your desk. You’ll have to 14 it.”

The chance passed and I did not 15 it. I sat the exam the next day and I won. I didn’t 16 to cheat, but it was still cheating anyhow.

That was thirty-eight years 17 when I was fifteen. I have never told anyone about it before, 18 have I tried to explain to myself why not.

The obvious explanation is that I could not admit I had seen the title 19 admitting that I had been looking at the things on his desk. 20 there must have been more behind it. Whatever it was, it has become a good example of how a little mistake can trap you in a more serious moral corner(道德困境).
