Two friends visited the zoo together. The zoo was very large and it was 1 to go everywhere. They had to decide where and which animal to visit as their time was 2 . So both of them agreed not to 3 after choosing a 4 at every fork.
A road sign at the first fork 5 one way to the lion quarters and the other to the tiger hill. They decided on the 6 after a 7 discussion because lions were “the king of the grassland”. The second showed a division going separately to the panda and peacock. They 8 panda as it was the nation’s treasure and went its way. Thus they made choices all along the way and each choice meant 9 what they couldn’t help regretting. But they had to make it, and 10 , for it brooked no delay. If they hesitated they would miss 11 . Only 12 decision could offer more chances for sightseeing and 13 possible regret.
Life is 14 like this—choices often occur that one has to make, for example, between two 15 jobs, two fascinating wooers. To get one you 16 give up the other—you can get half of it. If you 17 weighing the pros and cons and calculating gains and losses, you will most likely 18 empty-handedness. Don’t be sad about it. 19 you have got half of the desirable things in life—something that is 20 to come by.
