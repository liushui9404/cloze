The sculpture, a plastic bottle of melted ice from Antarctic, was the creation of the American-born artist and writer Wayne Hill.
But one light-fingered, and maybe 1 visitor to the exhibition may have 2 the point that the sculpture was intended to be a strong 3 on the danger of global 4 . The visitor is believed to have 5 the piece 6 considering the danger to the Antarctic icecap.
The police have been 7 to look into the mystery of the 8 water bottle, which disappeared at a festival at Dartington Hall in southern Devon. They are not sure if the thief knew the water was 9 of a sculpture and drank it as a 10 or if he 11 it for an ordinary bottle of water. Officers 12 say that someone 13 think the piece was just a/n 14 bottle and threw it away.
It was Wayne Hill who brought back two litres of melted ice from the west Antarctic and designed a bottle to 15 it. A notice on the bottle described where the water was from and 16 the words: “Weapon of Mass Destruction”, because of the 17 that melting icecap could bring.
Hill said, “ 18 the fact that it was designed to look like an ordinary object, it was clearly 19 out as an exhibit. If you put something on a base, people usually 20 it as a piece of art and treat it with respect.” Hill said he was considering making another identical piece.
