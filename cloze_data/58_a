The other day I was talking to a stranger on the bus; he told me that he had a good 1 in Chicago and he wondered if, by any chance, I 2 to know him. For a moment, I thought he might be 3 ,but I could tell from the expression on his face that he was not. He was 4 . I felt like saying that it was ridiculous to 5 that out of all the millions of people in Chicago I could possibly have ever bumped into his friend. But, 6 , I just smiled and reminded him that Chicago was a very 7 city. He nodded, and I thought he was going to be content to drop the subject and talk about something else. But I was wrong. He was silent for a few minutes, and then he 8 to tell me all about his friend.

His friend’s main 9 in life seemed to be tennis. He was an excellent tennis player , and he 10 had his own tennis court. There were a lot of people with swimming 11 , yet there were only two people with private tennis court; his friend in Chicago was one of them. I told him that I knew several 12 like that, including my brother, who was doctor in California. He 13 that maybe there were more private courts in the country, than he 14 but he did not know of any others. Then he asked me 15 my brother lived in California. When I said Sacramento, he said that was a coincidence 16 his Chicago friend spent the summer in Sacramento last year and he lived next door to a 17 who had a tennis court in his backyard. I said I felt that really was a coincidence because my next-door neighbour had gone to Sacramento last summer and had 18 the house next to my brother’s house. For a moment, we stared at each other, but we did not say anything.

“Would your friend’s name happen to be Roland Kirkwood?” I asked finally. He 19 and said, “Yes. Would your brother’s name happen to be Dr Rey Hunter?” It was my 20 to laugh. “Yes,” I replied.
