When I came out of my office, it was dark. In order to get home as soon as possible, I hired a taxi. The car was 1 along the road, now well-lit, now sank in darkness. I broke the 2 on purpose, 3 that the driver might be too tired to drive. “When do you go back home in the evening?”
“[9] o’clock. I’ll go after this trip.”
“Then when do you come out in the morning?” I 4 another question.
“[9] o’clock, too. And I go home for lunch and dinner, just as if I worked at an office.” His easiness surprised me, because every time I ride in a taxi, what I hear from the 5 are only complaints. They complain that they 6 work 7 , that it is 8 to earn money, that they are bullied by the policeman, or that the corporation leaders are seated 9 and enjoy the 10 of others’ work. It seems that they have a grievance against everything. But this driver told me, “I find it 11 to be a section chief as I was before. I don’t like management work. I like driving, just for 12 . It’s 13 that I 14 drive without a passenger. So I can earn two or three thousand yuan a month with ease. Any 15 ? Yes, I never follow an empty taxi. If it goes 16 , I go northward. If it goes along the highway, I turn into a 17 street. In this way I always get customers.
His words showed his satisfaction with his life and the pride he 18 in his job. Such feelings are so 19 among people nowadays as oxygen in high mountains. As an ancient saying 20 , “Neither joy in material gains nor grieve over personal setbacks.” How many people nowadays can show high ideals by simple living and go far with a calm mind? I couldn’t help feeling curious when I found such a state of mind in a stranger on a cold winter night.
