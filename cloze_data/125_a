About an hour later I was 3 to go. The waiter 4 me my coat. 5 something fell out of the pocket onto the floor. It was a small white box. Then I took a good look at the 6 . “Oh, you've brought someone 7 coat,” I said to the waiter. “It looks very much like mine, 8 it is quite new, and this isn’t my box .either.”
“Oh, then I 9 someone has taken your coat and left this,” said the waiter. “This kind of thing 10 sometimes.”
I opened the box. There was a beautiful gold ring in it. So I went 11 to the police station.
“ 12 lost a ring?” I asked.
“Yes,” said a policeman. “A young man who came in this morning lost a ring, he lost it in London.”
He 13 the young man. A few minutes later, the man arrived.

After I told him the 16 of the coat, he said, “You haven’t been on the train. I haven’t been in the hotel. So how did my ring 17 in the coat?”
“Did 18 sit or stand next to you on the train?” asked the policeman.
