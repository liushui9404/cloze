In the city of Fujisawa, Japan, lives a woman named Atsuko Saeki. When she was a teenager, she 1 of going to the United States. Most of what she knew about American 2 was from the textbooks she had read. “I had a 3 in mind: Daddy watching TV in the living-room, Mummy 4 cakes and their teenage daughter off to the cinema with her boyfriend.”

Atsuko 5 to attend college in California. When she arrived, however, she found it was not her 6 world. “People were struggling with problems and often seemed 7 ,” she said. “I felt very alone.”

One of her hardest 8 was physical education. “We played volleyball,” she said. “The other students were 9 it, but I wasn’t.”

One afternoon, the instructor asked Atsuko to 10 the ball to her teammates so they could knock it 11 the net. No problem for most people, but it terrified Atsuko. She was afraid of losing face 12 she failed.

A young man on her team 13 what she was going through. “He walked up to me and 14 , ‘Come on. You can do that.’”

“You will never understand how those words of 15 made me feel…Four words: You can do that. I felt like crying with happiness.”

She made it through the class. Perhaps she thanked the young man; she is not 16 .

Six years have passed. Atsuko is back in Japan, working as a salesclerk. “I have 17 forgotten the words,” she said. “When things are not going so well, I think of them.”

She is sure the young man had no idea how much his kindness 18 to her. “He probably doesn’t even remember it,” she said. That may be the lesson. Whenever you say something to a person cruel or kind—you have no idea how long the words will 19 . She’s all the way over in Japan, but still she hears those four 20 words: You can do that.
