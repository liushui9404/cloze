Learning to Accept

I learned how to accept life as it is from my father. 1 , he did not teach me acceptance when he was strong and healthy but rather when he was 2 and ill.

My father was 3 a strong man who loved being active, but a terrible illness 4 all that away. Now he can no longer walk and he must sit quietly in a chair all day. Even talking is 5 . One night, I went to visit him with my sisters, we started 6 about life, and I told them about one of my 7 . I said that we must always very often give things up 8 we grow—our youth, our beauty, our friends—but it always 9 that after we give something up, we gain something new in its place. Then suddenly my father 10 up. He said, “But, Petet. I gave up 11 ! What did I gain?” I thought and thought, but I could not think of anything to say. 12 , he answered his own question : “I 13 the love of my family.” I looked at my sisters, and saw tears in their eyes, along with hope and thankfulness.

I was also 14 by his words. After that, when I began to fell irritated(愤怒的) at someone, I 15 remember his words and become 16 . If he could replace his great pain with a feeling of love for others, then I should be 17 to give up my small irritations. In this 18 , I learned the power of acceptance from my father.

Sometimes I 19 what other things I could learned from him if I had listened more carefully when I was a boy. For now, though, I am grateful for this one 20 .
