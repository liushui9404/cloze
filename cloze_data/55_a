Tick, tock, tick, tock. I’m sitting here，watching the movements of my existence pass slowly away. My house has been 1 for such a long time, and I’m lonely and forgotten. Sitting here, by myself, all that I can do is 2 and think about my past. I could tell you stories that only 3 would know. But walls can’t speak.

I came to this place many years ago，along with an old man. 4 , he was with me for on1y three short years before he passed on.
　
For a time，I was left alone，while people came and 5 the house. Then，one day a nice couple moved in with a young son. 6 , their son Danny liked to stay with me, and I was completely 7 with him. He always looked as if he loved the stories I told，most of which began with. ‘‘Back in my day” and ‘‘When I was 8 .” I sometimes had the kind of idea that he didn’t really understand what I was saying，but it felt good to be 9 . When Danny went off to college, my heart broke. Soon afterward, 10 sold the house.

New owners came and 11 . Then，One day it so happened that I was in when a new family was moving into the house. You can’t even imagine my 12 when，unexpectedly, Danny walked through the front door. He had a 13 and kids now. I was so overjoyed when I saw him that I put all my 14 into my daily activities. I spent the next twenty years watching his kids grow up, with a mixture of pride and 15 about what would happen next.

The kids finally became 16 and Danny sold the house. That was about five years ago. Some of the local kids have started the rumor that the house is haunted and，in a way，it is. It is haunted by 17 of all the people who have lived in it. Every second has 18 me so much. I have been 19 them down and they are almost up for me. I hope that someday somebody will 20 me, and drop in on me again. Maybe then I’ll get a new home and an opportunity for a whole new set of memories.
