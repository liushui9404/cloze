Surfing: It’s Not Just for Boys Anymore
If you asked high school girls to name their favorite sports, most would probably say basketball or volleyball. I happen to be one of the few girls who would 1 : surfing. But isn’t that a boy thing? Some people 2 . Most certainly not.
I started surfing about five years ago and 3 in love with the sport on the very first day. Riding that first 4 was the best feeling I had ever experienced.
When I try to 5 surfing with other things, I find it very difficult because, in my 6 , there’s nothing like it. It involves body, 7 , and soul. There’s sand between my toes and cool, salt water all 8 us. The feeling I get when I’m surfing across that 9 , becoming one with the 10 , is like I’m weightless.
The one thing I can 11 from surfing and not any other sport is endless challenge. You can never be the “best surfer” because the ocean 12 an uncountable variety of waves that nobody can ever master. The variations of surfing styles are wonderful. Some surfers are free and lowing; others are very aggressive and 13 . All of these things attract me to surfing and make it 14 from any other sport.
I’ve 15 to tell every girl I know to do something that people don’t think girls can do. It’s part of being human to advance to new 16 , so shouldn’t it be expected that girls should step up and start 17 the limits of things boys and men used to dominate?
There’re women 18 side by side with the President of our country, so why not side by side with the boys 19 the football team or out in the water surfing? Give girls a chance to 20 , and they will.
