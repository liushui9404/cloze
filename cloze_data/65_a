The explorers found that the island had good soil 2 the [200] natives living there survived with little food. Even more 3 , these people also lived among the ruins of what might have been a once great civilization. All that is left of it are around [800] giant stone statues 4 human heads. They 5 up to [270] tons and the tallest measures over [11] metres. The stone men face 6 , rather than out to sea, and their eyes are focused upon the sky. They are all carved from 7 volcanic rock and some have hats on their heads and eyes made from white coral. Since their 8 , these huge stone men 9 one of the greatest mysteries of all time. Who built them? Why did they do it? Some experts believe the stone men are 10 to Inca stonework, and suggest the figures were created by people of Peruvian descent. 11 have even gone so far as to say that they came from outer space. The latest suggestion 12 the idea that Easter Island represents one of the worst cases of resource abuse in human history. It is said that a small group of Asians settled on Easter Island 13 between [400] and [700] AD. They developed a great civilization with huge forests and 14 food. At the peak of their civilization, the people began to build the giant 15 men. Why they did this is still 16 but it is possible the figures represent the settlers’ gods or ancestors. 17 the statues grew larger, the people’s lifestyles became more and more wasteful. The forest began to disappear, which 18 all the animals dying out. 19 couldn’t get food and were forced to eat other humans. Society began to 20 and the islanders themselves finally destroyed the stone men.
