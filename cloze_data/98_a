At the end of World War II, the Emperor of Japan must have regretted the 9 of Pearl Harbor. It brought to an end the Emperor’s 10 as a God to his people.

When it was revealed there were tapes 17 his involvement, he must have felt regret. If he had not tried to cover up the problem, he might never have had to leave office.
