At about nine this evening, a lady named Mrs Humney was 3 and killed. Anyone who can supply any clue is requested to report to the 4 . Thank you.” The terrible news made the lonely girl 5 with fear. She couldn’t help looking around, but she didn’t notice that a man was already 6 behind the door to the veranda.
All of a 7 the man appeared before Miss Wenter. The girl really didn’t know what to do. “Don’t ask for 8 , just put your jewellery on the table; then think over whether I shall be safe to stay up here for the night,” said the robber. That made Miss Wenter even more 9 , but she tried to 10 herself.
Just then came the whistle of a police car, In a little while, someone rang the 11 . The robber said with a gun 12 the girl’s back, “Go to the door and say that you’ve gone to bed. Never let him in.”
In a flash, the girl had an idea. “Oh, who are you?” she said.
“I’m Sergeant Bull, Miss Wenter. Is there something 13 here?”
“No, there isn’t.” Immediately she added loudly, 14 , my elder brother extends his 15 greetings to you.”
“Thank you. Good night,” Bull replied in the same 16 .
A few minutes later, the sound of the police car going 17 could be heard. “It’s well 18 ,” the robber said with a smile. Then he 19 to the girl. Almost at the same time the glass on the window was broken. The policemen hurried into the room from the veranda. They quickly put handcuffs on the robber.
“Miss Wenter, your greetings were so good that it made us take 20 right away,” said Sergeant Bull, because we’ve already known that your elder brother was killed in a robbery half a year ago.”
