“Oops.” I fell flat on my face and my books scattered on the ground. I muttered through closed teeth,” I forgot about that stupid bump. I’ve got to remember it tomorrow.”
Today there was a reason I was 1 . This was the day we had to 2 a poem in class. Although I had only lived in France for a few months, I still had to do all the homework from my classes in school.
Memorizing the poem had taken me hours, but I still wasn’t 3 if I would remember it when I stood up in front of class.
This 4 walk to school was always full of 5 . Every day I 6 pass a dog that lived by a church. The huge black animal with long teeth and a loud bark was my 7 . He had once taken me so completely by 8 that I had jumped in front of a car and was nearly 9 .
But today I had remembered to collect some stones to 10 . He would 11 for all the times he had given me a shock...but the beast wasn’t around today! 12 one time I was 13 to fight him and he was gone.
My mind 14 back to the poem. This was the first poem I’d tried to memorize.
When I got to school there were still a good five minutes before class. Then time came for the poem recitals.
“Would anyone like to 15 ?” asked Madame Thimonier.
I remembered my dad’s advice: “Just go first, and 16 everyone. Even if you forget part of the poem, you’ll have made a good impression!”
So I raised my hand. Madame Thimonier looked surprised.
I walked to the front of the room. I began and soon stumbled on the first line but managed to 17 from my mistake and continue. 18 was all coming back to me. Those hours spent memorizing the poem had 19 .
I kept reciting at a rapid pace. I looked over at Madame Thimonier and saw a look of astonishment on her face.
I walked back to my desk full of 20 after I had said the whole poem perfectly.
