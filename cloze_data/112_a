The Depression didn’t make much change in my grandparents’ lives. But it did bring an unending flow of men out of 1 , drifting from job to job, to the farm. The 2 to show up at the door of the kitchen was a man in rags. He quietly 3 that he hadn’t eaten for a while.

During lunch, the stranger didn’t 10 much, but when he left, his 11 straightened. “Nothing ruins a man like 12 his self-respect,” Grandpa later told me.
Soon after, another man 13 up asking for a meal. This one was dressed 14 a suit and carried a small suitcase.

The fellow set his suitcase 18 and neatly laid coat on top. Then he set 19 to work.
