In the summer vacation of 1997, I was fixed with a job. I worked as a(n) 36 at Mr. Breen’s fruit shop. The fruit shop did 37 business. Most of the trade came from the housewives who lived in the neighborhood, 38 he also had regular customers who arrived outside the shop in cars. Mr. Breen 39 them all by name and they sometimes even had their order already made up, always 40 me to carry it out to their car. They were clearly long-standing customers, and I 41 they must have stayed faithful to him 42 he had promised to sell good quality 43 . He had a way with them —I had to 44 that. He called every woman “madam” for a start, 45 those who clearly were not, but when he 46 it, it did not sound like flattery(奉承). It just sounded 47 in an old-fashioned way. He was a great chatter 48 .

If he did not know them, he would greet them with a few 49 about the weather, 50 he did, he would ask about their families or make 51 , always cutting his cloth 52 his customers. Whatever their bills came to, he 53 gave them back the few odd pence(零钱), and I am sure they thought he was very generous. But I thought he was the opposite. He never 54 anything away. He was always looking for 55 for nothing.
