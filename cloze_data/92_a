Two kinds of people exist in this world: clean people and people who have found millions of ways to avoid cleaning their rooms.
I belong to 1 because I am a teenager. Like all teenagers I am 2 busy pretending to be receiving an education to 3 that scientists attribute [52] percent of global warming to the 4 that escapes from my bedroom window. 5 all you 6 get too angry, I want you to know that I closed my window last week.
Don’t think the messy state of my room doesn’t 7 me, it does. Every night I go to sleep, haunted by the thought that a(n) 8 I lost three years ago is somewhere in my room still plugged in and waiting to start a fire. 9 thing that worries me is my fish. I haven’t gotten around to cleaning their tank this year. I can’t 10 if they’re alive or not.
A few weeks ago my mother ordered me to clean my room. She said: “Tracie, you 11 not eat, sleep, or breathe until you clean up your room.”
I responded, “Mum, did I tell you I got an A on my physics test yesterday?”
“You don’t even take physics, Tracie, so how can you get an A?”
My Mum was 12 than I thought, so I decided to ignore the question and change the 13 .
“Did you know that most kids today watch ten and a half hours of TV? And high school students score an average of [500] points 14 on the SATs than the kids in your generation.”
“No! Really? Well, Tracie, that’s just one more example of how the weak 15 of today affect the minds and education of the kids your age. Oh! I forgot to take the bread out of the oven !”
I smiled to myself for once again 16 my mother with perfectly useless and untrue 17 . Thereby I avoided the 18 task of cleaning my room.
Then I turned and observed the smoke and the big pile of smelly 19 . But, I am just too 20 to disturb the natural flow of things.
