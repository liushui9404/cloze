I played a racquetball game against my cousin Ed last week. It was one of the most 1 and tiring games I’ve ever had. When Ed first phoned and 2 we play, I laughed quietly, figuring on an 3 victory.

Then sudden realization was painful. We 16 to play like two mad men. When the score was 16 up, I was having serious 17 about staying alive until [21] years old, let alone 18 that many points. When the game finally ended, both of us were lying flat on our backs, too tired to 19 . In a way, I think we both won: I the game, but cousin Ed my 20 .
