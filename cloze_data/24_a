One summer day my father sent me to buy wire for our farm. At [16], I liked 1 better than driving our truck, 2 this time I was not happy. My father had told me I’d have to ask for credit(赊账) at the store.

Sixteen is a 3 age, when a young man wants respect, not charity. It was [1976], and the ugly 4 of racial discrimination was 5 a fact of life. I’d seen my friends ask for credit and then stand, head down, while the store owner 6 whether they were “good for it.” I knew black youths just like me who were 7 like thieves by the store clerk each time they went into a grocery.

My family was 8 . We paid our debts. But before harvest, cash was short. Would the store owner 9 us?

At Davis’s store, Buck Davis stood behind the cash desk, talking to a farmer. I nodded 10 I passed him on my way to the hardware shelves. When I brought my 11 to the cash desk, I said 12 , “I need to put this on credit.”

The farmer gave me an amused, distrustful 13 . But Buck’s face didn’t change. “Sure,” he said 14 . “Your daddy is 15 good for it.” He 16 to the other man, “This here is one of James William’s sons.”

The farmer nodded in a neighborly 17 . I was filled with pride. James William’s son. Those three words had opened a door to an adult’s respect and trust.

That day I discovered that the good name my parents had 18 brought our whole family the respect of our neighbors. Everyone knew what to 19 from a Williams: a decent person who kept his word and respected himself 20 much to do wrong.
