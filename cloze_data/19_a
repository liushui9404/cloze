Dear Laura,

I just heard you tell an old story of gift giving and unselfish love in your program. You doubted that such unselfish love would happen in today’s world. Well, I’m here to give you 1 .

I wanted to do something very 2 for my fifteen-year-old son, who has always been the perfect child. He 3 all summer to earn enough money to buy a used motorcycle. Then, he spent hours and hours on it 4 it looked almost new. I was so 5 of him that I bought him the shiniest helmet and a riding outfit.

I could 6 wait for him to open up his gift. In fact, I barely slept the night before. Upon awakening, I went to the kitchen to 7 the coffee, tea, and morning goodies. In the living room was a beautiful keyboard with a 8 :” To my wonderful mother, all my love, your son.”

I was so 9 . It had been a long-standing joke in our family that I wanted a piano so that I could 10 lessons. “Learn to play the piano, and I’ll get you one” was my husband’s 11 .

I stood there shocked, crying a river, asking myself how my son could 12 this expensive gift.

Of course, the 13 awoke, and my son was thrilled(激动的) with my reaction. Many kisses were 14 , and I immediately wanted him to 15 my gift.

As he saw the helmet and outfit, the look on his face was not 16 what I was expecting. Then I 17 that he has sold the motorcycle to get me the keyboard.

Of course I was the proudest mother 18 on that day, and my feet never hit the ground for a month.

So I wanted you to know, that kind of love still 19 and lives even in the ever-changing world of me, me, me!

I thought you’d love to 20 this story.

Yours,

Hilary

P.S. The next day, my husband and I bought him a new “used” already shiny motorcycle.
