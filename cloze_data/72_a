I was cleaning out an old box when an old card caught my eye: Queen City Casket Company. “What is it?” I wondered. I 1 it over. There, in faded ink, was a hand-scrawled 2 . Immediately my mind traveled 3 many years.
　　
I was nine years old, walking down the cold, wet streets of Springfield, with a bag of magazines on my shoulder. On my 4 that day, I came to that Company finally, whose owner, Mr Rader, had always taken me there to ask his workers 5 they wanted any magazines
　　
Shaking off the 6 like a wet dog, I entered Mr Rader’s office. After a quick glance he 7 me over to the fire-place. Noticing the 8 in the top of my 9 , he said, “Come with me!”, pulling me into his pickup 10 . We pulled to a stop before a shoe store. Inside, a salesman 11 me with the finest pair of Oxfords I had 12 seen. I 13 about [10] feet tall when I got up 14 them. “We’d like a pair of new socks too,” Mr Rader said.
　　
Back in his office, Mr Rader took out a 15 , wrote something on it, and handed it to me. With 16 eyes, I read, “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” He said affectionately (深情地), “Jimmy, I want you to 17 I love you.”
　　
I said good-bye, and for the first time I 18 a flicker of hope that somehow things would be 19 . With people like Mr Rader in the world, there was hope, kindness and love, and that would always make a 20 .
