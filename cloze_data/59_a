It was the last day of the final examination in a large eastern university. On the steps of one building, a group of engineering seniors gathered, discussing the exam due to begin in a few 1 . On their faces was confidence. This was their last exam — then on to 2 and jobs.
　　
Some talked of jobs they already had; others talked of jobs they 3 get. With the certainty of four years of college, they felt ready and able to take 4 of the world.
　　
The coming exam, they knew, would be a(n) 5 task. The professor had said they could bring 6 books or notes they wanted, requesting only that they did not 7 each other, during the test.
　　
 8 they entered the classroom. The professor passed out the papers. And smiles 9 on the students’ faces as they noted there were only five essay-type questions.
　　
Three hours had passed 10 the professor began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked confident. On their faces was a frightened expression. Papers in hand, no one spoke as the professor faced the class.
　　
He looked at the 11 faces before him, and then asked, “How many completed all five questions?” 12 a hand was raised.
　　
“How many answered four?” Still no hands.
　　
“Three? Two?” The students moved restlessly in their seats.
　　
“One, then? Certainly somebody finished 13 .” But the class remained silent.
　　
The professor put down the papers. “That is exactly what I 14 ,” he said. “I just want to impress upon you that, 15 you have completed four years of engineering, there are still many things about the 16 you don’t know. These questions you couldn’t answer are relatively 17 in everyday practice. ” Then smiling, he added, “You will all 18 this course, but remember — even though you are now college graduates, your education has just 19 .”
　　
The years have 20 the name of this professor, but not the lesson he taught.
