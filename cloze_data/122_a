I made a promise to myself on the drive down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I 1 try to be a loving husband and father. Totally 2 . No ifs, ands or buts.
The idea had come to me as I listened to a commentator 3 my car's tape player. He was 4 a passage about husbands being 5 of their wives. 6 he went on to say, "Love is an act of 7 . A person can choose to love." To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband 8 our love had been dulled by my own insensitivity. In unimportant ways, really; scolding Evelyn for her tardiness; 9 on the TV channel I wanted to watch; throwing 10 day-old newspapers that I knew Evelyn still wanted to read. Well, for two weeks all that would 11 .
And it 12 . Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, "That new yellow sweater looks 13 on you." "Oh, Tom, you noticed," she said, surprised and 14 , maybe a little puzzled.
After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn 15 a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, "Evelyn's been alone here with the children 16 week and now she wants to be alone with me." We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites.
So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street investment firm 17 I am director; a visit to the shell museum, 18 I usually hate museums (and I enjoyed it); 19 my tongue while Evelyn's getting ready for a late dinner for us. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new promise to keep on 20 to choose love.
