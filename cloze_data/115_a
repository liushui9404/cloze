When I smoked with my family, I would feel so 1 and good that nothing else in the world seemed to 2 . I thought that smoking weed was okay since many of my family members and people at my school smoked. 3 ever happened to them. 4 I started smoking weed a lot more during lunch and after school. I never thought 5 of it just that I wanted to smoke. Not that it was actually 6 my mind and body. Then I began to fall behind in school. I would 7 classes, come home late and spend all my baby-sitting money. I would spend 8 [8] to [18] dollars a day. I never thought 9 that marijuana had a bad effect on those things. Maybe my coming to class high was the reason why I was failing or coming home late. As I continued to smoke marijuana, I began to notice that I would always have the strong desire to smoke and that I would get 10 cigarettes if I smoked those, but I don’t. 11 I have learned more about marijuana, I have 12 the amount of marijuana that I use. I don’t want drugs to be the most important in my life. I’m not smoking every day, and not spending as much money. Now that I have 13 on my habit, I am 14 more money. I’m ready to go back to school and do good, so that I can make 15 of myself. Everyone is always saying how weed 16 your mind and how it solves problems. I think it only brings more 17 . Marijuana is not good for your body or your brain. I’m not trying to tell you not to smoke, I’m just letting you know that marijuana can be 18 to your health, and 19 it may cause some long term negative effects. Help yourself now, before it is too late. I don’t want to lecture anyone, just 20 my experience with you. I do still smoke, but not as often.
