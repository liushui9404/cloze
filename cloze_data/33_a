The year I went to college was a very difficult transition(过渡期) for me.

 1 is probably true with many people, I got quite homework and 2 thought about going home.

Although the 3 time for many students is getting 4 from home, my mailbox was frequently 5 . One day when I went to the mailbox, there was a postcard 6 out at me. I sat down to read it, 7 a note from someone back home. 8 I became increasingly puzzle as 9 postcards were like this: It was a full news report about a woman named Mabel and her newborn baby. I took the card back to my room and 10 about it.

Several days later I 11 another postcard, this one 12 news about Maybelline, Mabel’s cousin. Soon after, another card arrived and then another, 13 full of news of different people. I began to 14 look forward to the next one, 15 to see what this author would come up with 16 . I was never 17 .

Finally, the card 18 coming, right about the time I had begun to feel 19 college life. They had been such a happy distraction(调剂) that I have 20 all the postcards and still bring them out to read whenever I need a lift.
