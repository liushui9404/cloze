"You will meet a man in the theatre foyer," K. explained. "He will have left before the play ends and will be 1 for you. He'll be wearing a dark suit and carrying a theatre 2 upside down, although I doubt if you could miss him. There shouldn't be many people waiting in the foyer at that time of night. 3 he asks you to do, whatever instructions youâ€™re given, co-operate. Understood?" I nodded. I knew of course that we were planning to have discussions with "the other side" and that we intended to 4 back one of our own men, but all this seemed a bit ridiculous. I had been told at the training school that I would be likely to get some simple but rather strange 5 to begin with. They had been 6 .
The curtain had 7 come down on the last act of the play when I was out of my 8 and walking from the dark of the theatre into the bright lights of the foyer. He was there. But the moment I saw him, I had the 9 that something unpleasant was about to happen. He seemed to be 10 at a spot on the floor, and looked as if he was just about to pick something up when 11 was a single gun shot and he was thrown 12 the wall. The warning signs had obviously got to me 13 I realized consciously what was going to happen, because I had 14 in a cold sweat on seeing the expression on his 15 . The moment the shot rang out, I automatically fell back on my training and threw myself to the 16 .
When no more shots followed, I looked 17 and was just in time to see two masked men 18 my "contact" out of the front door of the theatre. I didn't know 19 he was dead or badly injured, but I intended to find out. I got up slowly and carefully and 20 for the door.
