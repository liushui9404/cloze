It was a freezing day, when I picked up a wallet in the street. There was nothing 1 but a letter that was 2 Hellen. On the torn 3 I found the return address, so I called information. The operator asked me to 4 on, and she came back on the 5 soon, she told me that Hellenes family had 6 their house years ago. Hellen had to 7 her mother in a nursing home.
I called and found out that Hellenes mother had 8 , The woman who answered 9 that Hellen herself was 10 living here.
The director waited for me at the 11 of the nursing home. I went up to the third floor. Hellen was an old woman with a warm smile and 12 eyes. I told her about finding the wallet and showed her the letter. She took a deep 13 “Young man,” she said, “this was the 14 letter I had written to Mike 60 years ago. I loved him very much. I guess no one ever 15 up to him. I still think of him…”
I thanked Hellen and came back to the director. His secretary looked at the wallet 16 and said, “Hey, that’s Mr. Goldstein’s. He’s always losing it. He’s 17 here on the 8th floor. That’s his wallet, for 18 .”
We hurried to him and asked 19 he had lost his wallet. Mike felt his back pocket and then said. “Goodness, it’s missing.”
When I returned him the wallet and told him where Hellen was, he grew 20 . “When the letter came,” He said, “my life ended. I never married.”
We took him to Helen’s room. They stood, looked at each other for a minute and embraced.
