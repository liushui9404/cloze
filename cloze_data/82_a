From time to time I received PC magazines from well-meaning editors. Reading them, I recognized the 1 characters, but the whole thing is Greek to me. When faced with such publications, I think to myself. “They might 2 send newspapers or magazines to a blind?” I 3 to say it, but I have to admit I don’t 4 know how to type, much 5 how to enjoy the internet. Several times I’ve tried to learn to use a computer and each time I gave up 6 , for it is not really very user-friendly. I was afraid of all mechanical 7 , afraid of the keyboard and the jumping mouse. I was content with the 8 that my classmate, Bai Yansong, another prime time host, also wrote his articles by 9 . He told me that feeling the 10 of the pen 11 the surface of the paper gave him a kind of 12 . I had the 13 feeling and found it a good excuse not to use a computer. By 1999, however, I 14 felt this attitude was right. One day I went to my supervisor’s home to 15 an article that was hand-written and a little muddily done. Hearing my 16 , the wife of my supervisor said, “It doesn’t matter. I can type it out on my computer.”
“You can use a computer?”
“Sure, I learned to use it when I was [70].”
I was so 17 that I wasn’t able to cry out a single word. 18 out of their flat, I made up my mind for the one-hundredth time to start learning to use a computer. I still had Bai Yansong to 19 me company, but once he started learning to use the computer, he would 20 very fast and then I would be really alone, wouldn’t I?
