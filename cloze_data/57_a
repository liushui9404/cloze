The worst thing is the headlines. I use the underground almost every day and watch the people travel, their heads 1 in their newspapers. The headlines today 2 suicide bombers and of horrific attacks that they say 3 by members of our community.

Something on the journey is 4 . I am not 5 anything that would indicate I am a Muslim. I normally do not 6 it is Friday and I am on my way to prayers. 7 I sense an uneasiness in the carriage. People are 8 . No one is speaking and it must be said that no one is being 9 unfriendly towards me. But I think the 10 I get are different. I am being checked out, sized up. It is all a bit uncomfortable.

People are looking around for things and people 11 look suspicious. I am doing it a bit 12 and in the coming days, as more claims are made about the people who did this and their aims, that feeling is likely to get 13 . As you look around the 14 , it is difficult to know what people are thinking. Some are 15 thinking â€œthose Muslims come here and look what they do" but they 16 understand we condemn this like everyone else.

Whoever did this didn't 17 about who was killed or whether they were Christian or Muslim. They just had no respect 18 human life at all. We all travel around London and we use public transport. We have as much fear as anyone else about 19 in something. But in the coming days, everyone is going to have to work together and keep calm. We will look out for each other and that's how we. will 20 this difficulty.
