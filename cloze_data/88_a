I was six when I joined my father and two elder brothers at sunrise in the fields of Eufaula, Okla. 1 the time I was eight I was helping Dad fix up old furniture. He gave me a cent for every nail I 2 out of old boards.
I got my first 3 job, at JM’s Restaurant in town, when I was [12]. My main responsibilities were 4 tables and washing dishes, 5 sometimes I helped cook.
Every day after school I would 6 to JM’s and work until ten. Even on Saturdays I 7 from two until eleven. At that age it was difficult going to work and 8 my friends run off to swim or play. I didn’t necessarily like work, but I loved what working 9 me to have. Because of my 10 I was always the one buying when my friends and I went to the local Tastee Freez. This made me 11 .
Word that I was trustworthy and hard-working 12 around town. A local clothing store offered me credit 13 I was only in seventh grade. I immediately 14 a [68] sports coat and a [22] pair of shoes. I was 15 only [65] cents an hour, and I already owed the storekeeper $90! So I learned 16 the danger of easy credit. I paid it 17 as soon as I could.
My first job taught me self-control, responsibility and brought me a 18 of personal satisfaction few of my friends had experienced. As my father, 19 worked three jobs, once told me, “If you 20 sacrifice and responsibility, there are not many things in life you can’t have.” How right he was.
