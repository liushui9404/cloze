School was over and I was both mentally and physically tired. I sat at the very front of the bus because of 1 to get home. Sitting at the front makes you 2 out like a shiny coin in a pile of dull pennies.
　　
Janie, the driver, tries to break the uncomfortable atmosphere by striking the match of 3 .
　　
I try to mind my manners and 4 listen, but usually I am too busy thinking about my day. On this day, 5 , her conversation was worth listening to.
　　
“My father’s sick, ” she said to no one in 6 . I could see the anxiety and fear in her eyes. With a sudden change of attitude and interest, I asked, “What’s wrong with him?”
　　
With her eyes wet and her voice tight from 7 the tears, she responded, “Heart trouble.” Her eyes 8 as she continued. “I’ve already lost my mum, so I don’t think I can 9 losing him.”
　　
I couldn’t respond. 1 was 10 My heart ached for her. I sat on the old, smelly seat thinking of the great 11 my own mother was thrown into when my father died.
　　
I saw how hard it was, 12 still is, for her. I wouldn’t like anyone to go through 13 .
　　
Suddenly I realized Janie wasn’t only a bus driver. That was just her job. She had a 14 world of family and concerns too. I had never thought of her as anything but a driver.
　　
I suddenly felt very 15 . I realized I had only thought of people as 16 as what their purposes were in my life. I paid no attention to Janie because she was a bus driver. I had judged her by her job and 17 as unimportant.
　　
For all I know, I’m just another person in 18 else’s world, and may not even be important. I should not have been so selfish and self—centred. Everyone 19 a place to go to, people to see and appointments to 20 . Understanding people is an art.
