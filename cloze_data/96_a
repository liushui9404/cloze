“Now,” Mrs. Virginia DeView said, smiling, “we are going to discover our professions.” The class seemed to be greatly surprised. Our professions? We were only [13] and [14] years old! The teacher must be 1 . “Yes, you will all be searching for your future 2 . Each of you will have to 3 someone in your field, plus give and oral report.”
Each day in her class, Virginia DeView reminded us about this. Finally, I picked print journalism. This 4 I had to go to interview a true-blue newspaper reporter. I was extremely nervous. I sat down in front of him 5 able to speak. He looked at me and said, “Did you bring a pencil or pen?”
I shook my head.

I shook my head again.
Finally, I thought he realized I was 7 , and I got my first big tip as a 8 . “Never, never go anywhere without a pen and paper. You never know what you’ll run into.” After a few days, I gave my oral report totally from 9 in class. I got an A on the entire project.
Years later, I was in college looking around for a new career, but with no success. Then I 10 Virginia DeView and my desire at 13 to be a journalist. And I called my parents. They didn’t 11 me. They just reminded me how competitive the field was and 12 all my life I had run away from competition. This was true. But journalism did something to me; it was in my blood. 13 gave me the freedom to go up to total strangers and ask what was 14 .
For the past 12 years, I’ve had the most satisfying reporting career, 15 stories from murders to airplane crashes and 16 choosing my strongest area. 17 I went to pick up my phone one day, an incredible wave of memories hit me and I realized that had it not been 18 Virginia DeView, I would not be sitting at that desk.
I get 19 all the time: “How did you pick journalism?”
“Well, you see, there was this teacher …” I always start out. I just wish I could 20 her.
