I was only eight years old when the Second World War ended, but I can still remember something about the 1 celebrations in the small town where I lived on the day when the war in Europe ended. We had not 2 much from the war where, though, like most children of my age, I often saw 3 houses in the streets and the very big 4 lorries passing through. But both at home and at school I had become 5 to the phrases “before the war” and “when the war is over”. “Before the war”, obviously, 6 had been better, though I was too young to understand why, 7 there had been no bombs then, and people had eaten things like ice cream and bananas, which I had 8 heard of. When the war was over we would go back to London, but this meant very 9 to me. I did not remember what London was like.
　　
What I remember now 10 V-Day was the afternoon and the evening. Some boys and girls were collecting 11 and building an enormous bonfire. We stood and watched them for a time, and then I went home and 12 myself in with my key and waited for my parents to come back from work.
　　
It was May and still broad 13 when my mother arrived, and my father came in about an hour later. After dinner I said I wanted to 14 the bonfire, so when it got dark my father took me to the end of the street. The bonfire was very 15 , and somehow people had collected some old clothes to 16 “Hitler” with the moustache they had put on top of it. Just as we arrived, they set light to it. The flames 17 soon. Everyone was cheering and shouting.
　　
I stood beside my father until the 18 started to go down, not knowing what to say. He said nothing, either. He had 19 in the First World War and remembered everything he had experienced. At last he said, “Well, that’s it, son. Let’s hope that this time it really will be the 20 one.”
