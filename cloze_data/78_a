“My name’s Jim Shelley and I’m an addict.”
　　
With these words I began to 1 the problem, the problem of my telephone addiction. I used to call people 2 , from the moment I woke up to the time I went to sleep. I 3 to be phoned, I wanted to phone. Just one more call.
　　
It started socially—a few calls each day. It seemed 4 , just a quick chat. Gradually though, the 5 got worse. Soon it was 6 use, until, finally, addiction.
　　
And it began to affect my 7 . During the day I would disappear for 8 call. If I couldn’t make a call, I spent the whole time waiting for the phone to ring. Getting more and more 9 , in the end, I would ring someone, then someone else, 10 myself just one more call.
　　
I was phoning people and 11 messages to make sure 12 calls would see me through the day. I used to arrive at friends’ homes and before the door was closed, go straight for the phone with the 13 “Is it OK if I just use the phone …?” At work, I became 14 when my fellow workers tried to 15 me from using the phone. And one day I hit my boss (with the phone). Finally the police caught me 16 a phone box that had taken my last one pound coin, and I was 17 to see a psychiatrist.
　　
I haven’t 18 a phone in the house for three weeks now, and it’s several days 19 I used a phone box. I try not to watch TV because there are 20 people on it making phone calls. My name is Jim Shelley and I am an addict.
