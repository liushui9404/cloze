What is intelligence anyway? When I was in the army I 1 an intelligence test that all soldiers took, and, against 2 of [100], scored [160].
I had an auto-repair man once, who, on these intelligence tests, could not 3 have scored more than [80]. 4 , when anything went wrong with my car I hurried to him—and he always 5 it.
Well, then, suppose my auto-repair man 6 questions for some intelligence tests. By every one of them I’d prove myself a 7 . In a world where I have to work with my 8 , I’d do poorly.
Consider my auto-repair man 9 . He had a habit of telling 10 . One time he said, “Doc, a deaf-and-dumb man 11 some nails. Having entered a store, he put two fingers together on the counter and made 12 movements with the other hand. The clerk brought him a hammer. He 13 his head and pointed to the two fingers he was hammering. The clerk 14 him some nails. He picked out the right size and left. Well, Doc, the 15 man who came in was blind. He wanted scissors. 16 do you suppose he asked for them?” I lifted my right hand and made scissoring movements with my first two fingers. He burst out laughing and said, “Why, you fool, he used his 17 and asked for them. I’ve been 18 that on all my customers today, but I knew 19 I’d catch you.” “Why is that?” I asked. “Because you are so goddamned educated, Doc. I knew you couldn’t be very 20 .”
And I have an uneasy feeling he had something there.
