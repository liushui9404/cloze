I grew up in a community called Estepona. I was [16] when one morning, Dad told me I could drive him into a 1 village called Mijas, on condition that I took the car in to be 2 at a nearby garage. I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas, and 3 to pick him up at [4] pm, then dropped off the car at the 4 . With several hours to spare, l went to a theater. 5 , when the last movie finished, it was six. I was two hours late!

I knew Dad would be angry if he 6 I’d been watching movies. So I decided not to tell him the truth. When I 7 there I apologized for being late, and told him I’d 8 as quickly as I could, but that the car had needed a major repairs. I’ll never forget the 9 he gave me. “I'm disappointed you 10 you have to lie to me, Jason.” Dad looked at me again. “When you didn’t 11 , I called the garage to ask if there were any 12 , and they told me you hadn’t yet picked up the car.” I felt 13 as I weakly told him the real reason. A 14 passed through Dad as he listened attentively. “I'm angry with 15 . I realize I’ve failed as a father. I’m going to walk home now and think seriously about 16 I’ve gone wrong all these years.” “But Dad, it’s [18] miles!” My protests and apologies were 17 . Dad walked home that day. I drove behind him, 18 him all the way, but he walked silently.

Seeing Dad in so much 19 and emotional pain was my most painful experience. However, it was 20 the most successful lesson. I have never lied since.
