On my first day in a college classroom, I felt like an overgrown child returning to civilization after having been lost in the forest for thirty years. There I sat, 1 enough to be a father to most of the students in the room, 2 unconfident enough to be their baby brother. We were crowded elbow to elbow, listening to a 3 who looked even younger than the students. I felt uncomfortable and out of place as the professor carefully 4 what she expected us to learn. As I listened, I couldn't help but 5 of my own oldest daughter who was now beginning her first year in 6 , just like me. I remembered how hard I had tried to help build self-confidence in her and my other children. So why did I suddenly feel like a scared 7 myself? When I walked out of that classroom, I had serious 8 about my ability to make it 9 college. Not until late that night did my thinking 10 . It was a long-distance 11 from my daughter, my fellow college freshman , that did the trick. She spoke on the phone about the doubts, worries and anxieties she was 12 . She was certain that she’d never 13 at college. How 14 her worries sounded. In my most confident parental 15 , I said, “Doing your best is all the world 16 .” The next day in class, those words still repeated in my head. When the professor raised a 17 for the class, nobody, including me, 18 to answer. When I looked around at the 19 and uncertainty on the young faces in that room, I knew 20 what I had to do: my best. That’s all the world asks. So I raised my hand, and the professor called my name. I spoke.
